        <p>This chart shows some suspicious activity with the USA olympic team.
            They are clearly trash for decades, and then all of a sudden they bring 19 golds home in 1960.

        <h3>What happened between 1955 and 1960? you may ask.</h3>

        <h2>It all makes sense now.</h2>
        <p>
            Even before Putin, Russia was put'in it down in the Olympics using steroids in 1954. America saw this, and presumably threatened to tell on them if Russia didn't share the goods.</br> </br> The rest is history.

        <h2>Total Medal Count by Country in Descending Rank</h2>
        <h3>Pie charts show bronze to silver to gold per designated country</h3>
        <p>This figure backs up the fact that America is just a bunch of cheaters. 
            There's no way they're better than Canada.</p>

            <p>I used matplotlib to do these pie charts, I saved them as SVGs and incorporated them into my final graphic.
